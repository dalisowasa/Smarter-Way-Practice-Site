        <h2>The most fantastic animal in the world.</h2>
        <p>The giant panda is a species of bear that is found in the mountains of central and western China. One of the most popular and distinguishable animals in the world, the giant panda is also one of the rarest. Habitat loss threatens this gentle creature although the Chinese government has done much to improve its outlook. The giant panda is unique among bears as they do not hibernate, have very small babies at birth and survive on a diet that is almost entirely vegetarian. Since the giant panda was first discovered by a French naturalist in 1869, it has become a global symbol for conservation with the World Wildlife Fund using it as its logo. The Chinese people also see the giant panda as a symbol of peace and numerous efforts have been made to try and protect the remaining populations in their native habitats.</p>
